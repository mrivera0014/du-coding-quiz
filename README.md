# du-coding-quiz

## Description
In this project I created a responsive timed quiz with multiple choice questions. This project allowed me to test my current knowledge on Javascript fundamentals. Since this was a project that I had to start from scratch I struggled a lot. I began by setting up my html and css files and linking my files together. 

Once I was ready to start my Javascript code I began by pseudo coding. This made it easier for me to actually write code later because I was able to focus on one part of my code at a time. Where as in last time I was jumping from one section to the other making it even harder to read. I thought about what order everything would show up to the user and worked on the functions in that order. After sometime I did find myself stuck and my struggle was I wasn't sure on how to connect some of my functions or how to grab the correct elements from my html. 

Even though I had many small wins, this project made me realize that I have a lot of progress to make and that I need to put more hours into understanding how everything works. I plan on working on the algorithms and going back and re trying class activities because I know that this is all going to effect future homework assignments and projects. 

Again I know I had many small wins and those motivate me to continue putting in the effort to get a better understanding of Javascript.
